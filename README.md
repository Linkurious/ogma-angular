# Ogma-Angular

This is an example on how to use [Ogma](https://doc.linkurious.com/ogma/latest/) with [Angular 16](https://angular.io/) and [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/guide/store).

## Getting started

Clone and install the dependencies
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Linkurious/ogma-angular.git
cd ./ogma-angular
```

Set your `API_KEY` in `package.json` to install Ogma and then run 
```sh 
npm install
```

Start Angular server and code watch:
```sh
npm run start
```

Go to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).

## Status

This is a work in progress: the app builds and shows an Ogma visualisation but does not include NgRx state yet. Stay tuned !
